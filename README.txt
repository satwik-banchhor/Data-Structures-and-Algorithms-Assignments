This repository contains all my Data Structures and Algorithms related assignments. 

A summary of all the Assignments:-
➢ Differentiation - Recursive Descent Parser
	o Built a Recursive Descent Parser to parse a string expression with binary and unary operators into a binary tree.
	o Invoked recursion to differentiate the binary tree and regained the differentiated string expression using inorder traversal of the tree.
➢ Hashing - Double Hashing & Separate Chaining(BST)
	o Implemented hashing using double hashing by creating two hash functions and maintaining the load factor to be less than 2/3.
	o Implemented hashing using separate chaining by implementing and using binary search trees to store items that hash to the same slots in the tables
➢ Online Selling Platform Model
	o Designed a Priority Queue representing a catalog of products having producer defined priorities.
	o Employed multi-process synchronization techniques allowing catalog access to multiple producers and consumers.
➢ StudentDatabase
	o Created a maintainable database of students under the interrelated entities:-
		▪ Hostels
		▪ Departments
		▪ Courses
	o Implemented linked-lists to store the data of the entities and the students retrieval.
